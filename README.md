## Overview of the Analysis

The client, a nonprofit, provided a dataset containing information from previous orgnizations that have received funding from them. The client requested a deep learning model be created to be used in the future to assist the foundation in making assessments on where they should invest. The model evaluates the features provided in the dataset in order to determine whethor or not the organizations funded by the client successfully achieved their stated goal in their grant applications.

## Results

#### Data Preprocessing
- The IS_SUCCESSFUL column of the provided dataset was considered the target for this model.
- The features of the model consisted of the following columns from the provided dataset:
  * APPLICATION_TYPE
  * AFFILIATION
  * CLASSIFICATION
  * USE_CASE
  * ORGANIZATION
  * STATUS
  * INCOME_AMT
  * SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS
  * ASK_AMT
- The EIN and NAME columns were removed from the dataset when compiliing, evaluating, and training the model.

#### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
